# Shoot Run

"Shoot Run" is a fun terminal-based shooting game that revolves around a shooter tasked with eliminating zombies.

The shooter has a health level, symbolized by blood. With each zombie attack, the shooterâ€™s health diminishes. If his health runs out, he transforms into a zombie himself then game over.

The game features a moving portal in each room, which the shooter can use to escape. Note that, the more zombies the shooter eliminates, the more zombies become aware of his presence, leading to an increase in the number of zombies in the game.
